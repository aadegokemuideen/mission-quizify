[Gemini-Quizify]

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my work and projects in the fields of machine learning, AI, and software development. Below is a brief introduction to my background and some details about the repository.
About Me

Hello! My name is [Muideen Adegoke], and I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering. My expertise lies in learning algorithms and neural network models under imperfect implementations. During my PhD, I developed several innovative algorithms and implemented them using Python and MATLAB. My work extensively involved statistical techniques, linear algebra, and optimization methods.

I am currently a Research Fellow at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, where I focus on applied machine learning applications. My projects include building energy use prediction, pollution avoidance support systems (PASS), air pollution analysis, and object detection applications. These projects have allowed me to master various tools and technologies, including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Linux, MongoDB, Terraform, AWS, Git, Jira, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NLTK, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

### About Me:
Hello! My name is Muideen Adegoke, and I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering. My expertise lies in learning algorithms and neural network models under imperfect implementations. During my PhD, I developed several innovative algorithms and implemented them using Python and MATLAB. My work extensively involved statistical techniques, linear algebra, NLP/GenAI, Large Language Model Optimization/finetuning and optimization methods.

I am currently a Research/Machine learning Engineer at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, where I focus on applied machine learning applications. My projects include building NLP systems,  energy use prediction, pollution avoidance support systems (PASS), air pollution analysis, Graph theory and application, and object detection applications. These projects have allowed me to master various tools and technologies, including Python, Pandas,  NumPy, Scikit-learn, Linux, FastAPI, MongoDB, Terraform, AWS, Git, Jira, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NLTK, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

**This Project: ReX/Gemini-Quizify - The AI Coach**

## Overview

I leveraged technologies such as OpenAI and Google Gemini to develop, generally, ReX (in particular for this repo (Gemini-Quizify), an AI Coach who serves as a steadfast career companion for learners,
offering personalized coaching, mentorship, and support throughout the various phases of their career lifecycle. 

### Skills: Gemini · Python (Programming Language) · Large laguange models (LLMs) · LangChain · OpenAI · streamlit · langchain-google-vertexai · chromadb


## Gemini-Quizify
In this repository, I present Gemini-Quizify, an AI Coach developed using advanced AI technologies such as Google Gemini. Gemini-Quizify serves as a steadfast career companion for learners, offering personalized help to assist learners in digesting complex text from textbooks/written text.

### Features:
- Users of Gemini-Quizify can ask questions based on the uploaded text.
- Users can create quizzes from the written text or textbook to test their understanding.
- The Gemini-Quizify agent assists learners in verifying their comprehension of the material they are studying.

### Technologies Used
- Gemini
- Python (Programming Language)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- LangChain
- OpenAI
- Streamlit
- langchain-google-vertexai
- ChromaDB
